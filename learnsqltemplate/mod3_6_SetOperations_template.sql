-- Note: We will use the university_large database for this example.

/*	We will use the following two sets for our discussion of the UNION,
	INTERSECT, and EXCEPT operations:		*/

	--	The set of all courses taught in the Fall 2009 semester.



	--	The set of all courses taught in the Spring 2010 semester.



-- The Union Operation

	/*	Query: "Find the set of all courses taught in Fall 2009, or in Spring 2010, or in both."	*/



-- The Intersect Operation

	/*	Query: "Find the set of all courses taught in both Fall 2009 and Spring 2010."	*/



-- The Except Operation

	/*	Query: "Find the set of all courses taught in Fall 2009 but not in Spring 2010."	*/
